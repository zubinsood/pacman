# Project Title and Description

My app is called Pac Man. One player can play Pac Man on the browser, with the score being kept automatically and game results displayed at then end of a round -- either when a player collects all pellets or when a player collides with an enemy ghost. Users will have the option to play again. In the future, I'd like to add a bigger map, more ghosts, more power-ups, and animations.

# Usage & Features & Controls

Use W, A, S, D or Up, Left, Down, Right to control the yellow circle. Your goal is to consume all of the small pellets on the board without coming in contact with any of the 4 ghosts. If you consume a larger pellet (Power Pellet), you will be able to consume a ghost and wipe it from the board! Be careful though, as the power pellets last 5 seconds.

# Gameplay Mechanics

There is a score count for cosmetic purposes currently. Each pellet is 10 points and each power pellet is 50 points. Again, this is only cosmetic for now as there are a finite amount of pellets on the board, so the score is not relevant.

# Known Issues / Bugs

- Sound may be scuffed
- Movement can feel rigid now and then
- Refreshing browser will not always play opening audio
- Ghosts phase through their cage initially
- Ghost AI is too easy
